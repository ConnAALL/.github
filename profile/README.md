## Autonomous Agent Learning Lab
The central theme for research in this lab is autonomous agent learning. The agents are robots, models of robots, and interactive video game players. The learning is usually a form of evolutionary computation and almost always some type of computational intelligence. The agents are autonomous in the respect that they can operate on their own and the learning either takes place before operation or can happen during operation using learning systems that are offline from the agent. Most of the learning is for control programs, although some is for the morphology of the robot or control/morphology in combination.
